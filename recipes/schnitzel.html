        Schnitzel is a German delicacy that can be used with porkloin, chicken, or veal.
        If you have not tried it, they are super easy to make and of course delicous.

    <p>
        One of my favorite dishes to eat <strong>has</strong> to be schintzel. It's 
        incredibly delicious and actually a <em>ton</em> of fun to make.

    <h4>
        Steps:
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Alright my friends, the first step is always to prep your workstation.</li>
        <li>Trim pork chops of fat and slice them into 1/2" thick cutlets</li>
        <li>Pound those bad boys (no not like that you sicko!) into 1/4" to 1/8" thick pieces</li>
        <li>Set up three bowls</li>
        <li>In the first bowl we are going to combine 1/3 cup of flour, 1 tablespoon of garlic salt, a half tespoon of paprika, and a half teaspoon of pepper</li>
        <li>In the second bowl, beat those eggs up!</li>
        <li>What goes in the third bowl Louis? Well, we've got those panko crumbs! Go ahead and pour 'em in there</li>
        <li>Now, we're going to take those meat cutlets and dip them in the flour</li>
        <li>Next dip the flour-coated cutlet into the beaten eggs, let the excess egg drip off back into the bowl</li>
        <li>Take that egg-flour meat contraption and dip into the panko crumbs to form a nice even crust</li>
        <li>Repeat this process to bread all of the cutlets</li>
        <li>Now add oil to a non stick pan, just enough to cover the whole bottom of the pan</li>
        <li>Fry those babies up! Should take about 3-4 minutes per side</li>
        <li><em>Wowza!</em> you smell that! Bet you cannot <strong>wait</strong> to take a bite! I don't blame you but don't forget the lemons!</li>
        <li>Serve it up! Condiments can be mustard, ranch, ketchup, or pretty much anything!</li>
    </ol>
